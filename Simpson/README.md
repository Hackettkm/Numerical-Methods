# Simpson

## Purpose:
To estimate the integration from a given data set.

## How:
The Simpson function works to estimate the sum of all the f(x) values of a set of equally spaced data. It works by taking the area for a parabola connecting 3 points then adding up all the parabolas with a specified equation. If there are an even number of points (an odd number of segments), the function uses the trapezoidal rule on the last segment of the given data. 

### Inputs:
*x* - independent variables
*y* - dependent variables (w/ respect to x)

### Outputs:
*I* - integral (of the vector of function values 'y' w/ respect to 'x')


## Limitations:


## Other Useful Information:

#### Equations:
Simpson's 1/3 Rule


Trapezoidal Rule
