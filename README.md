# Numerical-Methods
The following repository includes numerical method algorithms created for Mechanical Engineering 105 for the spring 2018 semester.

## What are Numerical Methods?
Algorithms that recast "mathematical operations into the simple kind of algebraic and logical operations compatiable with digital computers."     - Applied Numerical Methods by Steven C. Chapa Chapter 1 Section 3

Life is not made of exact answers; it is made of estimations. As an engineer, our job is to use these numerical methods to determine the best possible estimate with the lowest possible computational time. The goal is to find a balance between the accuracy and the time to be as efficient as possible.

Numerical Methods in Mech 105 focus on root finding, optimization, and solving systems of simultaneous linear algebraic equations.

## Included Methods:

  ### 1. False Position #####(linear interpolations method)
  A root locating method that uses an interval to bracket the root. A straight line is drawn connecting the endpoints of the function over the interval. Where the line crosses the x-axis is where the new root it located. The new root then replaces the x-value of which ever endpoint creates a y value with the same sign as the y value produced from plugging the new root into the function. This process is repeated until a desirable estimation is achieved.
